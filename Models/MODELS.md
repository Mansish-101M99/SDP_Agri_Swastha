# Machine Learning Models for Our Project

We will utilize the following four powerful machine learning models to achieve optimal results in our project:

---

## 🚀 Logistic Regression
A simple yet effective linear model for classification tasks. Logistic Regression is widely used for its interpretability and efficiency in binary and multiclass problems.

---

## 🤝 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm. KNN classifies data points based on the majority label among their nearest neighbors, making it intuitive and easy to implement.

---

## 🛡️ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A robust and versatile model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes. SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is known for its accuracy in complex datasets.

---

## 🌳 Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results. Random Forests are highly accurate, handle overfitting well, and work with both categorical and numerical features.

---

> **In summary:**
> We will leverage these four models—Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest Classifier—to ensure comprehensive analysis and high performance in our project.
